# Rust Calculator

This is a very simple CLI calculator written in Rust just to make me learn it in a simple way. :monkey_face:

### Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
#### Prerequisites

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  
[Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) (comes with Rust)

#### Run
- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Type `cargo` to install dependecies
- Now type `cargo run` to run the program


#### Usage

Once the binary is running:

  Choose the operation you want to perform by typing a number between 1 and 5:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit

- Enter the first number.
- Enter the second number.

The calculator will then perform the chosen operation on the two inputted numbers and print out the result. It will also print the every calculation.
